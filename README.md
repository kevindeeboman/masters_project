# Masters project - Spring 2021 

Description: 
Current measures of labor demand have many issues. They tend to be expensive quarterly
surveys that captures changes in labor demand with a considerable lag. Meanwhile, digital job ads are becoming more important for labor market research. The increasing use of
online platforms for finding employees makes the platforms a more reliable representation of the labor market. By looking at the Swedish official job ads platform, Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen, we propose to create an index that gauges labor demand in terms of how many jobs are advertised online. Using this index, available jobs will be calculated daily, which can be used as a proxy measure of current labor demand. This demand will be compared to official statistics, published quarterly, to evaluate precision.
